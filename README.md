Welcome to AlgoMap.io, your comprehensive resource for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DS&A) for Big Tech company interviews!

## üéØ Project Objective

AlgoMap.io is designed to be your one-stop destination for learning and understanding algorithms and data structures. My goal is to provide:

1. A vast collection of algorithm problems
2. Detailed solutions with explanations
3. In-depth breakdowns of the algorithms used
4. Educational content to help you master DS&A
5. Preparation materials for Big Tech company interviews

## üìö Repository Contents

This repository contains:

1. **Problem Descriptions**: Clearly stated algorithm problems, categorized by topic and difficulty.
2. **Solutions**: Efficient and well-commented code solutions for each problem.
3. **Explanations**: Detailed explanations of the logic and approach used in each solution.
4. **Algorithm Breakdowns**: In-depth analyses of the algorithms employed, including time and space complexity discussions.
5. **Educational Resources**: Tutorials, articles, and guides to help you understand fundamental and advanced DS&A concepts.
6. **Interview Prep**: Tips, tricks, and strategies for tackling algorithm problems in interview settings.
